The AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack e-commerce application, 3D Stuff, from initial concept to a production-ready MVP. The development followed an iterative process, addressing user requests for frontend design, backend functionality, payment integration, and post-launch features. Key accomplishments include the implementation of a modern React frontend using Shadcn UI, a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, a complete Mercado Pago payment system (PIX, credit card, boleto, webhooks), automated inventory management, email confirmations, and a highly customizable WhatsApp contact system. The AI also managed branding elements, such as logo recoloring and site-wide theme changes, demonstrating adaptability to evolving design preferences. The trajectory concludes with the AI having provided tools for product management and being in the process of testing them.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a conversion-optimized landing page following specific design guidelines, emphasizing layered design, glass-morphism, distinct CTAs, and emotional impact. The development evolved with the following explicit feature requests:
1.  **Initial Frontend Development:** Creation of a functional frontend with mock data, including interactive elements and a WhatsApp contact button.
2.  **Backend Implementation:** Development of a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, including API contracts, data models, and replacing frontend mock data with real API calls.
3.  **Payment Gateway Integration:** Implementation of an online payment system. User initially inquired about Stripe but explicitly requested **Mercado Pago**, desiring PIX, credit card, and boleto options, alongside secure transaction handling.
4.  **Post-Launch Features:** Guidance on Mercado Pago webhook configuration, an automated email system for confirmations (payments, contact), inventory management with automatic stock updates, and configuration for a custom domain ().
5.  **WhatsApp Integration Refinement:** Configuration of the WhatsApp contact system with a real phone number (), evolving from a prominent banner to a small, discreet floating icon.
6.  **Branding Customization:** Recoloring a provided logo to match site aesthetics (initially orange, then blue).
7.  **Site Theme Change:** A site-wide color palette transformation from orange to blue.
8.  **Product Management:** Tools and guidance for adding new products to the catalog.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on enabling the user to add products to the application. The user explicitly asked, Perfeito! o site est√° no ar, agora gostaria de saber como adiciono produtos para vender (Chat Message 199). In response, the AI created three new files: , , and . These files provide the necessary scripts and guidance for product management. The AI engineer's immediate next action is to test the script for you (Chat Message 202) to ensure the newly created product addition functionality works as expected. The application currently features a complete e-commerce website with a blue theme, custom logo, Mercado Pago payment integration, automated inventory, email confirmations, and a discreet floating WhatsApp contact button configured with the user's real number.
